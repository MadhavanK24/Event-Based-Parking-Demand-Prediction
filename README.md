# Event-Based-Parking-Demand-Prediction
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to predict parking demand based on real-time event data from sources like Twitter API, Google Trends, and event listings. Unlike the 8051, the ESP32 has built-in Wi-Fi and higher processing power, allowing direct communication with APIs and handling basic machine learning tasks. The system controls parking availability displays, entry barriers, and alerts based on predicted demand.
